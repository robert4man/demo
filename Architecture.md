# Architecture

We are using the design and layout
of <a href="https://c4model.com/" rel="nofollow">https://c4model.com/</a> to
model the LEO software.  This is a work in progress.  See the attached
Giffy charts. 

  

Some terminology: 

ORSP = Office Of Research and Sponsored Programs.

Uniterm Number = ORSP Project Number.  A Uniterm can have multiple
proposals.

PI = Personal Investigator.  The main responsible researcher.

CO PI = Co Personal Investigator.  Person doing a lot of work with the
PI.

CO-I = Co Investigator.  Not doing as much work but still helping with
proposal.

KEY = Key personnel.  Budget People.  Helpers.

GCA = Grant Accounting

PTA = Project Task Award (used by grant accounting)

Direct Sponsor = Who is paying for the research directly. (Ohio State →
Ohio University)?

Indirect Sponsor = Who did the funds come from (National Science
Foundation → Ohio State → Ohio University)

DGM = Departmental Guarantee Memorandum

Unit = Organizational Unit in LEO.  We have colleges and colleges have
departments

Delegates =  Each unit can have delegates.  So a dean of a college can
have many delegates.  Some of those delegates can approve and deny forms
on behalf of the dean or chair. 

COI = Conflict Of Interest.  We make sure that when researchers are paid
to do research that they have a COI created saying they do or do not
have a conflict of interest.

CITI = Collaborative IRB Training Initiative.  Allows researchers to be
certified in different aspects of research.

IRB = Human Subjects.  Give quizzes to students, psychology experiments
...

IACUC = Animal Subjects.  If you are observing or using animal
subjects.  Also includes antibiotics. 

Office Of Research Compliance = Office that handles COI, CITI, IRB and
IACUC
