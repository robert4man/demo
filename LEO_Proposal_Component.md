# LEO Proposal Component

  

  

When a transmittal is approved and becomes a proposal ORSP will assign
it a uniterm number.  This is a unique number that identifies the
project.  A uniterm can have multiple proposals under it.  When ORSP
manages a proposal there are many things that  the grant managers do. 
They add comments, upload files, manage sponsors (who is paying for the
research), compliance queue, colleges and departments, faculty members
and much much more.  Everything that ORSP enters into LEO can
practically be seen by the researchers and their delegates.  ORSP will
then submit the proposal to the sponsor to be reviewed.  If the sponsor
accepts the proposal then the award letter process / DGM (department
guarantee memorandum) starts.  If the proposal is denied then we mark
the proposal as denied.
